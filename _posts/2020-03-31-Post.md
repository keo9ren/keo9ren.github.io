title: Typescript - Properties with no intersection
--- 

You might, eventually, end up with the following typescript code 
(which runs perfectly fine in javascript btw):

```typescript
function intersectionExample(intersection: {a: string} | {b: string}) {
       if (intersection.a) {//a
         console.log(intersection.a); // b
       }
}
```

Which lead to this error on both line a and b:
```
Error(1): TS2339: Property 'a' does not exist on type
           '{ a: string; } | { b: string; }'.
          Property 'a' does not exist on type '{ b: string; }'.
```

So how to tell typescript compiler I'm now what I'm doing?
Just use the ```in``` statement of javascript.  

```typescript
function intersectionExample(intersection: {a: string} | {b: string}) {
       if ('a' in intersection) {//a
         console.log(intersection.a); // b
       }
}
```

The solution here looks rather easy, although I had to search quite a bit for it. 
Actually, due to the sloppiness of javascript I never really had to use the ```in```
statement on my daily work, it was always good enough to simple access the property
and if it's there work with, like in the first failing example.
