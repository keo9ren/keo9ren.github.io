I'm a full stack developer from germany. Currently working with [COS GmbH](https://www.cosonline.de/),
building datacentric apps, based on web technologies, which can basically run anywhere; Native on iOS or Android as well as on the Desktop PC in the web browser.
To feed the apps with user data I'm building Java EE (Wildfly) server at the backend, gathering the data, from a large existing Oracle Database.
